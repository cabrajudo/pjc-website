# Judo and society

Given the dynamics of our changing society, judo has a lot to offer. 

  - Judo recognises individual differences while at the same time caters for team-work within the club. 

  - Some students may have an opportunity to experience administrative roles within the club. 

  - Judo is a wonderful medium for integration. There is a mutual understanding between players the world over and it is common to find players of various nationalities practicing judo together. 

  - As with any form of sport or martial art, it can serve as a great confidence builder, but most of all it is there to be enjoyed. 

Judo has something to offer everybody. It is a completely natural activity for children. It can be a tough and demanding sport that will challenge any boy or girl and leave them contented at the end of a training session.
