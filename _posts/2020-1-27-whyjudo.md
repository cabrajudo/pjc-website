## What’s in it for children

1.  **Self-defence** Judo teaches you the techniques to defend yourself, but also the way to think about defending yourself, while developing your reflexes, fitness and confidence

2.  **Measuring progress** Judo uses a system of Colored belts to indicate the knowledge and skill levels of players, giving kids goals to work towards and a means of measuring progress

3.  **Self-confidence** Through practice children become more self-assured and confident both on the judo mat (tatami) in the dojo (judo hall) but also in life

4.  **Exercise** A judo class starts with warm up followed by practice in pairs both throws and groundwork. Workouts develop muscles and cardiovascular system as well as coordination

5.  **Individual achievement** No child gets left on the bench in judo and its goal is the lifelong pursuit of individual perfection

6.  **Discipline** Repetition of drills alone, or in pairs, teaches children both patience and the benefits of frequent practice, helping them to learn and develop, showing respect at all times

7.  **Efficiency** Judo works by maximising efficiency, using the opponent's momentum against him/her

8.  **Equality** Judo is one of the few sports where both boys and girls of every ethnicity, colour and religion play together in every lesson

9.  **Self-control** Instructors teach children that judo should never be used to bully or intimidate others

10. **Competition** teaches humility in victory and dignity in defeat, while respecting their opponent, while allowing them to gauge their progress
